Stock_Price_Prediction

This project is a stock price prediction model built using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) algorithm. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for making predictions based on time series data, such as stock prices.

Data

The model is trained on historical stock price data obtained from Yahoo Finance. The data includes the open, high, low, and closing prices of the stock you want to predict the price for, adjusted close prices as well as the volume of shares traded. The dataset covers a period of seven years, with daily data points.
